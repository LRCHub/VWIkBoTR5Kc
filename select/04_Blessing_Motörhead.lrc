[00:00.77] Oh Lord, who art on high
[00:03.95] Who has made the blades of grass and the little tiny things that creep therein
[00:12.38] That hath made the cricked bats, who has made hankies and who has made
[00:18.35] All things
[00:25.02] Bless thou, these people from Motörhead
[00:29.92] That they may so verily endow the people of this planet with pleasure and enjoyment
[00:37.88] That yea, they may verily increase fourfold
[00:41.87] Their already large sums of loot and enable them here in this life to purchase maybe one other pair of trousers each
[00:51.34] Oh Lord, thou who has seen the trouserless and had compassion
[00:56.06] Look down upon them, thank You

Follow the light
You won't find anyone
You won't find anything
Only the secrets that you fear
See how the light it blinds you every time
And leaves the darkest sky
Brighter than anything you fear

Time to say goodbye
Knowing that we only have a moment
Time to say goodbye
Maybe in the end we are all blessed
Time to say goodbye
Feel the universe starting over
Time to say goodbye
Waiting for the end of all we know

Behind the light we feel the helplessness
We fear the emptiness
Knowing that oblivion is near
But at the end
We believe everything
We redeem all our sins
But do we know anything?

Time to say goodbye
Knowing that we only have a moment
Time to say goodbye
Maybe in the end we are all blessed
Time to say goodbye
Feel the universe starting over
Time to say goodbye
Waiting for the end of all we know

There's no one here
There's no one left
So beautiful the emptiness
There's no more fear
There's no regret
So beautiful the emptiness

There's no one here
There's no one left
So beautiful the emptiness
There's no more fear
There's no regret
So beautiful the emptiness
